      <h3>Artistic Documentation</h3>    

      <h4>Artistic Vision</h4>
      <p>We then moved on to the artistic component of the installation: I chose to have white text on a black
        background, displaying a selection of verbs that incite motion. Living is moving, and living is feeling. 
        It is easy to sleep the days away, so I thought I would use this project to revitilize myself. I chose a delay of 
        500 ms between each new word, and began with the word "go." The constant changing of the words, and the 
        word "go" separated from all the rest pushes the viewer to listen, to go. Life is improvisation, and 
        improvisation is randomness. Yet there is a power in simplicity. I wanted my display to be undistracting, 
        yet clear. This is why I set each word in the exact same location, except for "go". This is why each verb
        is only one syllable. The rigidity in only 10 words makes space for the viewer's imagination. 
      </p>
      <img src="/esp32.PNG" alt="esp32 displaying the word 'dance'" style="height: 300px;"/>
    <p>
        I originally only chose four words: "run", "dance", "fly", and "jump". There were many other 
        contendors ("play", "move", "make", "grow"), but I realized that just as it is important to physically act,
        it is important to emotionally act. Taking internal, mental action is also the opposite of sleep, in a way. 
        I added "feel", "cry", "cheer", "draw", and "need". I wasn't sure if these were perfect, but that was okay. 
        I want this code to be a work in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something unexpected that I thought I would take out but turned out to enjoy was when my code 
        randomly chose the same word twice. I had a black screen come for a moment between each word, so it
        really does look like the word is repeated. This felt powerful, and I like how the art itself 
        took my intention and message, and gave me back something unexpected and inventive in its 
        generative component.
      </p>
      <h4>The Installation</h4>
      <p>
        It was exciting to see my work next to everyone elses. Other people did more with color, and 
        I enjoyed the contrast between their complexity and my simplicity. Watch this video to see clips
        from the day of the installation, as well as the text from my device. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Challenges that I experienced in this project centered on the powering of the device, yet it also was 
        one of the most fulfilling aspects of the journey. We were given lipo batteries, and after plugging mine 
        into my board, the board heated up. I got a new board, and went to the Design Center to solder my JST 
        connector. Luckily for me, I experienced no issues. I was able to cut, strip, solder, and use a hairdryer
        on the heat shrink until I had a fully soldered battery. As someone often afraid of hardware, it 
        felt empowering and in line with the artistic aspect of this installation to feel a sort of ownership 
        over the physical technology we used.

        To try this yourself, follow the below technical description, or follow this link to my code repository.

      <h4>Setting up the Hardware </h4>
      
      <p>This project consists of a breadboard, 7 wires, and three main pieces of hardware: an ESP32, a joystick, 
	and a button. Plug the pins of the hardware into the breadboard, and connected them further with wires: 
	connect the joystick to the ESP32 with one wire to Ground, one to 3V, and the other three to pins 25, 26, 
	and 27 for X, Y, and Z motion; connect the button with one wire to Ground, and the other to pin 13 for 
	digital input. The ESP32 is powered via a USBC cable.
</p>

      <h4>Flashing Code to the ESP32</h4>
      
      <p>
	After setting up our hardware, flash the code found in `src/main.cpp` to your ESP32. This 
	allows you to recieve serial input from the joystick and the button. In the code, change the 
	pin numbers if you used different GPIO pins when setting up the hardware. You can either write 
	this code in the Arduino application or through the VSCode IDE PlatformIO. Select the port, and 
	set the baudrate to match whatever you value you put in your `src/main.cpp` code (ex. `Serial.begin(115200)`.) 
	To set the baudrate in PlatformIO, in `platformio.ini`, add the line `monitor_speed = 115200`, 
	where 115200 is the baudrate. 
      </br>  
      To check that you are recieving serial input, open the Serial Moniter. As you move the joystick 
      and press the button, you should watch the values change.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Reading Serial Input</h4>
      
      <p>Once you confirm you are recieving serial input, you need to retrieve that input so you can parse it. 
	This is done in `reader.py`. First install the python module serial with `pip install pyserial`. Use 
	the line `ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbserial-546F1153241', 115200)` to tell serial the port and baudrate. 
	`str(ser.readline().strip(), 'ascii')` returns a string of the serial input you are recieving 
	from your hardware; this line is inside an infinite while loop, so you are continuously recieving 
	lines of input. From there, you can use those values as variables that change color, or position, 
	or any other features of your display.
</p>

      <h4>Creating My Display with PyGame</h4>
      
      <p>PyGame is a helpful Python library that allows for the display of graphics in games. 
	PyGame's documentation has helpful examples, and provide good explanations for various 
	functions you can use to create simple games:
	</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/">https://www.pygame.org/docs</a></p>
	
	I built a game that has a moving circle (controlled by the joystick) that gets 
	trapped in an invisble square, and to get out of the square, one must press the button 
	on the joystick. This also has the effect of randomly changing the color of the circle. 
	The button acts as a free pass, changing the color of the cricle continuously, and 
	circumventing the square of doom. Here is a picture of 'Steal the Color' in action:
